* flaky trackpoint - running xeyes can prevent this issue somehow?
  Oct 15 10:50:43 t480 kernel: psmouse serio2: TrackPoint at rmi4-00.fn03/serio0/input0 lost synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Touchpad_Synaptics#Touchpad_synchronization_issues
* frequent wakeup from s2idle
  - when trackpoint or mouse button is touched
  - when power source is connected, etc.
* general font size in UI
* console font to prioritize ja glyphs
* cannot select color profiles
* async snap installation
* spellcheck and smart composing in Gmail are not working in Firefox somehow
* check-language-support doesn't work unless the lang is explicitly specified
